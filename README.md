# EpiCode

This Project is a School project for the 4 semester at EPITA, which has to be coded in C. 

## Project Summary
EpiCode will be QRCode alike, it will be a bi-dimensional matrix, machine readable, that contains information about the item to which it is attached. The project's aim will be to develop a software capable of both generating EpiCodes and reading them.

Generating an EpiCode will be the processing data part. The input data can be a web address, some text, numbers or any other information, and then it is morphed into an image. On the other hand, we have the reading part, which will involve image processing, as well as well as the decryption of the information contained in the given motif.
